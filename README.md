## üìñ Project Overview  
This project was created for the **Onyx Data x ZoomCharts Mini Challenge (October 2025)**.  

The challenge placed participants in the role of a **Data Analyst at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)**‚Äîa U.S. government agency that ensures transparency and fairness in the financial sector.  

The CFPB collects consumer complaints related to financial products and services, tracking each complaint from submission through the company‚Äôs response.  
The goal of this dashboard is to analyze complaint patterns, response efficiency, and company performance to identify trends and insights valuable to both regulators and consumers.
